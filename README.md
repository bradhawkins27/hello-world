This Is A Learning Process!!!!

Wow! I have no idea what the hell I am doing but this looks like a lot of fun to learn.  Any advice would be awesome!!!

I am currently enrolled in college at Southern New Hampshire University getting my Bachelor's in Geosciences.  Computers is not really my strengh but I am willing to learn as much I possibly can.  I had never even heard of Github until the other day but it does look like a lot of fun to possibly gain some knowledge.  Knowledge is always a great thing and powerful.  

Thanks for checking this out and any help is greatly appreciated.
